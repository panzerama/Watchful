# Watchful
Allows you to track the social media of politicians and fact-check their statements

Roadmap:
1) Twitter messages displayed, tapping directs user to a list of web results (corroboration)
2) Messages displayed with number of web search hits that have a relatively high percentage of relevance (corroboration with confidence)
3) Basic analysis: if low number of relevant links from search, analyze tweet (validation by corroboration)
4) More complex sentiment analysis: does this message exhibit strong features of sentiment (validation by sentiment)
